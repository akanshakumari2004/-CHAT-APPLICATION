I developed a real-time chat room interface where users can type messages and see them displayed instantly on the screen. Although it appears to be a simple local chat interface (without a backend server), it demonstrates frontend chat UI design and message handling using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key Features of Your Chat Room

Clean and Organized Interface

The chat room is displayed inside a styled card with a heading: "CODTECH Chat Room".

Messages are shown as separate blocks, making the chat visually clear.

Message Input and Send Button

A text input field allows the user to type a message.

A Send button triggers the JavaScript function that adds the message to the chat window dynamically.

Dynamic Message Display

When a user types a message and clicks "Send", the message immediately appears in the chat window.

Messages are appended dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation without reloading the page.

Simple CSS Styling

The interface is centered and uses soft colors.

The send button uses a red background for clear visibility.

Messages are displayed inside shaded or bordered blocks for better readability.

Side-by-Side Layout (Optional Feature)

The screenshot shows two chat room cards, possibly indicating multiple instances of the same chat application on the same page, simulating a multi-user environment (or showing how the app looks on different screens).
Tools and Technologies Used

Editor: Visual Studio Code (or any preferred code editor).

Languages:

HTML for structure.

CSS for design and responsiveness.

JavaScript for adding functionality (dynamic messages).

Browser Testing: Chrome or Firefox to check how the chat updates dynamically.
